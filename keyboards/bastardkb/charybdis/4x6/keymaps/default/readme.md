# Charybdis (4x6) default keymap

<<<<<<< HEAD
> :bulb: Have a look at the [`via` keymap](../via) for a more feature-rich
> layout.

The Charydbis (4x6) default keymap is inspired from the original [Dactyl
Manuform](../../../../../handwired/dactyl_manuform) default keymap.

This layout supports RGB matrix. However, due to space constraints on the MCU,
only a limited number of effect can be enabled at once. Look at the `config.h`
file and enable your favorite effect.
